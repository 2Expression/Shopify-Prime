# Shopify Prime

Shopify Prime is a NodeJS library built to help developers easily authenticate and make calls against the Shopify API. It was inspired by and borrows heavily from my other Shopify library, [ShopifySharp](https://github.com/nozzlegear/shopifysharp).

**This lib is a work in progress. Please check back soon!**
